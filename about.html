          Assagio d'italia was founded by three creative minds, Elizabeth, V,
          and Patrick. One a brit, the other an aussie and the other a latina.
          The three of our founders grew up in Florence, Italy. They had a love
          for creating such fun dishes that would entertain their families and
          community. After 20 years of deciding which institute to study at, the
          founders finally met at Nōssi college of art, An art institute in
          Florence, yes they never left Florence. They were all accepted into
          the culinary program and wanted to use their abilities to help serve
          others and bring a smile to people's faces like that had down over all
          these years. The idea of an authentic Tuscan restaurant was something
          a ll three of them agreed on after falling in love with the dishes and
          its origin. Sketching out ideas for a restaurant that they had a long
          time ago. The three of them came together to create ASSAGIO D'ITALIA.
          That translates to this day into, “A taste of Italy.” Assagio d'italia
          is in Florence Italy to this day.
