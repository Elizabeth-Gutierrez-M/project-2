            Assagio d'italia was founded by three creative minds, Elizabeth, V,
            and Patrick. One a brit, the other an aussie and the other a latina.
            The three of our founders grew up in Florence, Italy. They had a
            love for creating such fun dishes that would entertain their
            families and community. After 20 years of deciding which institute
            to study at, the founders finally met at Nōssi college of art, An
            art institute in Florence, yes they never left Florence.

            They were all accepted into the culinary program and wanted to use
            their abilities to help serve others and bring a smile to people's
            faces like that had down over all these years. The idea of an
            authentic Tuscan restaurant was something a ll three of them agreed
            on after falling in love with the dishes and its origin. Sketching
            out ideas for a restaurant that they had a long time ago. The three
            of them came together to create ASSAGIO D,ITALIA. That translates to
            this day into, “A taste of Italy.”
